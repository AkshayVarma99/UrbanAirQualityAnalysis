# Air Quality Uncovered: Mapping Pollution Hotspots in Urban Spaces

### Overview
Welcome to *Air Quality Uncovered*! This project takes you through an in-depth analysis of urban air pollution in major English cities, revealing pollution hotspots and examining factors like traffic density and industrial activity that impact air quality. With powerful geospatial analysis and data visualization, we bring air quality data to life to inspire cleaner, healthier urban environments.

### About
*Air Quality Uncovered* dives into air pollution across urban areas, pinpointing high-risk zones and exploring the root causes of poor air quality. Using Python libraries like GeoPandas and Folium, we create interactive maps and data visualizations that inform and guide urban planning, environmental policies, and public health initiatives.

### Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Explore air quality metrics across different locations and times.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Visualize pollution hotspots with dynamic, interactive maps.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Use spatial regression to analyze relationships between pollution and urban factors.
- **Reproducible & Open-Source**: Built entirely with open-source tools, this project can be adapted to other regions or studies.
